		"Waiting upstairs, the boy becomes really nervous and confused as he recounts the days events in his head. He decides to read a book to take his mind off things while he waits for his dad to get home.",
		"After the kid read a signifigant portion of War and Peace, he finally hears dad get home. After some soft conversation with his wife the father comes upstars and states: \"Tell me why you're in trouble, son.\"",
		"\"Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to go ask my teacher. Thinking my teacher would know what it meant, I told her this story and she sent me to the principals office. After waiting in line for the better part of an hour, I was finally allowed in and the principal, once hearing my story, expelled me from school. I walked home and mother wonderd why, so I told her this story and she sent me upstairs.\"",
		"\"What was the name?\"",
		"\"Purple Whiff.\"",
		"There is no way a son of mine is going to live under my roof with a mouth like that. So the father sends the boy to military school."
