<!-- Mother -->
<p>Waking home, the kid mulls over the day and realizes he is confused ans scared to talk to his parents.</p>
<p>Finally getting home, his mother suprises him ans he forgot it was her day off. She asks "Why are you home early from school?"</p>
<p>"Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to go ask my teacher. Thinking my teacher would know what it meant, I told her this story and she sent me to the principals office. After waiting in line for the better part of an hour, I was finally allowed in and the principal, once hearing my story, expelled me from school."</p>
<p>"That is outrageous. I am calling the school right now. What name did that boy call you?"</p>
<p>"Purple Whiff."</p>
<p>"I did not raise a son with such a bad mouth. Go upstairs and wait for you father to come home."</p>
