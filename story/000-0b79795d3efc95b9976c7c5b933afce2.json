		"There was this kid who was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when he decided that he wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. He goes over and asked the big bad fifth graders if he could play with them, and one of the fifth graders walks up to him and says \"no.\"",
		"The kid says \"Well, why not?\"",
		"The fifth graders responds \"Because you're a Purple Whiff.\"",
		"The first kid is confused and says \"What does that mean?\"",
		"The big, bad fifth graders respond: \"You are obviously a Purple Whiff because you don't even know what it means. If you really want to know about it, go ask your teacher.\""
