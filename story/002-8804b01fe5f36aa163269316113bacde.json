		"After spending the betteer half of an hour waiting in line for the principal's office, the kid finaly gets called in. The principle states that he is fairly confused as the teacher was vague with her reasoning and asks the kid \"Why don't you tell me what got you here.\".",
		"\"Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to go ask my teacher. Thinking my teacher would know what it meant, I told her this story and now I am here, in your office.\"",
		"The principal responds: \"That is very strange, what was the name?\".",
		"\"They called me a Purple Whiff\".",
		"With a look of pure horror, the principle expells the kid and sends him home from school."
