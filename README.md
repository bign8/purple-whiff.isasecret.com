# Purple Whiff

There was this kid who was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when he decided that he wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. He goes over and asked the big bad fifth graders if he could play with them, and one of the fifth graders walks up to him and says "no."

The kid says "Well, why not?"

The fifth graders responds "Because you're a Purple Whiff."

The first kid is confused and says "What does that mean?"

The big, bad fifth graders respond: "You are obviously a Purple Whiff because you don't even know what it means. If you really want to know about it, go ask your teacher."

------

The kid goes inside from recess to talk to his teacher.  The kid walks back into the classroom and the teacher says "It's recess, why are you inside?"

The kid looks up at her at says "Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to come ask you about it."

Thinking it's just another dumb school yard game, the teacher asks "Well, what was the name?"

The kid says "Purple Whiff."

As the teacher stampers backward in suprizement, she points to the door and sends the kid to the principal's office.

-----

After spending the betteer half of an hour waiting in line for the principal's office, the kid finaly gets called in.  The principle states that he is fairly confused as the teacher was vague with her reasoning and asks the kid "Why don't you tell me what got you here.".

"Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to go ask my teacher.  Thinking my teacher would know what it meant, I told her this story and now I am here, in your office."

The principal responds: "That is very strange, what was the name?".

"They called me a Purple Whiff".  

With a look of pure horror, the principle expells the kid and sends him home from schoo.
