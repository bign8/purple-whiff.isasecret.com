			<p>So there was this kid who was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when he decided that he wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. He goes over and asked the big bad fifth graders if he could play with them, and one of the fifth graders walks up to him and says "no."</p>
			<p>The kid says "Well, why not?" and the fifth graders responds "Because you're a purple whiff."</p>
			<p>The first kid is confused and says "What does that mean?"</p>
			<p>The big, bad fifth graders responds: "You are obviously a purple whiff because you don't even know what it means. If you really want to know about it, go ask your teacher."</p>
			<p>And so the kid goes inside from recess to talk to his teacher.</p>
			<p>The kid walks back into the classroom and the teacher says "it's recess, why are you inside?"</p>
			<p>The kid looks up at her at says "well...(recount playground story from kid's point of view.) They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to come ask you about it."</p>
			<p>So thinking it's just another dumb school yard game, the teacher asks "well, what was the name?" and the kid says "purple whiff."</p>
			<p>And so the teacher sends the kid to the principal's office</p>
			<p>I'm getting bored typing this behemoth story, so i'm going to give you the condensed story, and we can do proofreading or something</p>
			<p>waiting in line...gets called in...principal confused...teacher was vague..."why don't you tell me what got you here."</p>
			<p>(kid tells playground and teacher story)</p>
			<p>"That is very strange," says the principal. "What was the name?"</p>
			<p>Purple whiff</p>
			<p>So the kid gets expelled and sent home from school</p>
			<p>walking home...confused...scared to talk to parents...gets home...mom is there on her day off..."why are you home early from school?"</p>
			<p>(recount playground, teacher, and principal stories)</p>
			<p>"That is outrageous. I am calling the school right now. What name did that boy call you?"</p>
			<p>Purple whiff.</p>
			<p>So the boy gets sent upstairs to wait for his dad to get home</p>
			<p>waiting upstairs...reading a book...really nervous and confused...hears dad get home...dad comes upstairs... "tell me why you're in trouble, son."</p>
			<p>(recount playground, teacher, principal, and mother stories)</p>
			<p>"what was the name?" purple whiff</p>
			<p>so the boy gets sent to military school</p>
			<p>in military school...works hard...good kid...noticed by commanding officer...day before graduation, officer pulls boy aside..."you're a good kid...never had attitude problems with you...why are you here?"</p>
			<p>(recount playground, teacher, principal, mother, father stories)</p>
			<p>"that's weird...what was the name?"</p>
			<p>purple whiff</p>
			<p>so the boy gets sent to military prison</p>
			<p>in military prison...well behaved...warden starts giving him odd jobs...become friends...one day warden pulls him aside, asks "you're a good guy and your files are vague, why are you even in military prison?"</p>
			<p>(recount playground, teacher, principal, mother, father, military school stories)</p>
			<p>name?</p>
			<p>purple whiff</p>
			<p>so he gets sent out on the street to be a bum</p>
			<p>rock bottom...begging for change...no money...no house...nothing...lady comes up to give money, asks: "before I give you this, i want to hear your life story. How did you get to where you are right now?"</p>
			<p>guy says: "It's a long story...every time i tell it, something terrible happens...can you please just give me some money so i can eat tonight?"</p>
			<p>lady says: "well how can things get any worse for you?"</p>
			<p>guy says "you're right."</p>
			<p>(recount playground, teacher, principal, mother, father, military school, prison stories.)</p>
			<p>name?</p>
			<p>purple whiff</p>
			<p>lady looks down...thinking....guy looks up at her hopefully...lady says "I know a guy that can tell you what it means...go two blocks then right, three blocks then left, and you'll see him.)</p>
			<p>guy gets up and walks two blocks, then turns right, is almost to the third block and he sees the guy...something about it...going to learn about the phrase that ruined his life...crossing the street...IMMEDIATELY gets hit by a bus</p>
			<p>and that is why you never cross the street without looking both ways</p>
