					<!-- Introduction -->
					<p>There was this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child">kid</a> who was on the playground playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_square">four square</a> with the third graders when he decided that he wanted to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickball">kickball</a> with the big, bad fifth graders. He goes over and asked the big bad fifth graders if he could play with them, and one of the fifth graders walks up to him and says "no."</p>
					<p>The kid says "Well, why not?"</p>
					<p>The fifth graders responds "Because you're a Purple Whiff."</p>
					<p>The first kid is confused and says "What does that mean?"</p>
					<p>The big, bad fifth graders respond: "You are obviously a Purple Whiff because you don't even know what it means. If you really want to know about it, go ask your teacher."</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Teacher -->
					<p>The kid goes inside from recess to talk to his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher">teacher</a>. The kid walks back into the classroom and the teacher says "It's recess, why are you inside?"</p>
					<p>The kid looks up at her at says "Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to come ask you about it."</p>
					<p>Thinking it's just another dumb school yard game, the teacher asks "Well, what was the name?"</p>
					<p>The kid says "Purple Whiff."</p>
					<p>As the teacher stampers backward in suprizement, she points to the door and sends the kid to the principal's office.</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Principal -->
					<p>After spending the betteer half of an hour waiting in line for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher">principal</a>'s office, the kid finaly gets called in. The principle states that he is fairly confused as the teacher was vague with her reasoning and asks the kid "Why don't you tell me what got you here.".</p>
					<p>"Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to go ask my teacher. Thinking my teacher would know what it meant, I told her this story and now I am here, in your office."</p>
					<p>The principal responds: "That is very strange, what was the name?".</p>
					<p>"They called me a Purple Whiff".</p>
					<p>With a look of pure horror, the principle expells the kid and sends him home from schoo.</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Mother -->
					<p>Waking home, the kid mulls over the day and realizes he is confused ans scared to talk to his parents.</p>
					<p>Finally getting home, his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother">mother</a> suprises him ans he forgot it was her day off. She asks "Why are you home early from school?"</p>
					<p>"Well, I was on the playground playing four square with the third graders when I decided I wanted to play kickball with the big, bad fifth graders. So I went over and asked them if I could play with them. They told me no and called me a name, but I didn't know what the name meant, and they told me to go ask my teacher. Thinking my teacher would know what it meant, I told her this story and she sent me to the principals office. After waiting in line for the better part of an hour, I was finally allowed in and the principal, once hearing my story, expelled me from school."</p>
					<p>"That is outrageous. I am calling the school right now. What name did that boy call you?"</p>
					<p>"Purple Whiff."</p>
					<p>"I did not raise a son with such a bad mouth. Go upstairs and wait for you father to come home."</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Father -->
					<p>Waiting upstairs, the boy becomes really nervous and confused as he recounts the days events in his head. He decides to read a book to take his mind off things while he waits for his dad to get home.</p>
					<p>After the kid read a signifigant portion of War and Peace, he finally hears dad get home. After some soft conversation with his wife the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father">father</a> comes upstars and states: "Tell me why you're in trouble, son."</p>

I walked home and mother wonderd why, so I told her this story and she sent me upstairs."</p>
					<p>"What was the name?"</p>
					<p>"Purple Whiff."</p>
					<p>There is no way a son of mine is going to live under my roof with a mouth like that. So the father sends the boy to military school.</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Military -->
					<p>in military school...works hard...good kid...noticed by commanding officer...day before graduation, officer pulls boy aside..."you're a good kid...never had attitude problems with you...why are you here?"</p>
					<p>(recount playground, teacher, principal, mother, father stories)</p>
					<p>"that's weird...what was the name?"</p>
					<p>purple whiff</p>
					<p>so the boy gets sent to military prison</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Prison -->
					<p>in military prison...well behaved...warden starts giving him odd jobs...become friends...one day warden pulls him aside, asks "you're a good guy and your files are vague, why are you even in military prison?"</p>
					<p>(recount playground, teacher, principal, mother, father, military school stories)</p>
					<p>name?</p>
					<p>purple whiff</p>
					<p>so he gets sent out on the street to be a bum</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Rock Bottom -->
					<p>rock bottom...begging for change...no money...no house...nothing...lady comes up to give money, asks: "before I give you this, i want to hear your life story. How did you get to where you are right now?"</p>
					<p>guy says: "It's a long story...every time i tell it, something terrible happens...can you please just give me some money so i can eat tonight?"</p>
					<p>lady says: "well how can things get any worse for you?"</p>
					<p>guy says "you're right."</p>
					<p>(recount playground, teacher, principal, mother, father, military school, prison stories.)</p>
					<p>name?</p>
					<p>purple whiff</p>
					<p>lady looks down...thinking....guy looks up at her hopefully...lady says "I know a guy that can tell you what it means...go two blocks then right, three blocks then left, and you'll see him.)</p>
					<hr />

					<!-- Conclusion -->
					<p>guy gets up and walks two blocks, then turns right, is almost to the third block and he sees the guy...something about it...going to learn about the phrase that ruined his life...crossing the street...IMMEDIATELY gets hit by a bus</p>
					<p>and that is why you never cross the street without looking both ways</p>
